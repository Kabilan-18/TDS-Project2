### Correlation Analysis
The correlation heatmap illustrates the relationships between various factors. Notably, the 'Log GDP per capita' and 'Life Ladder' show a strong positive correlation (0.78), indicating that higher GDP is associated with higher happiness levels.
Additionally, 'Social support' and 'Life Ladder' also display a strong correlation (0.72). This suggests that social connectedness plays a significant role in overall happiness.
Conversely, variables like 'Generosity' and 'Negative affect' exhibit weaker or negative correlations with happiness measures.
